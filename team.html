			    <p>	Life is a classroom all in itself.  Yes, I have learned the basics of my trade through university, however, the real teacher has been life.</p>  
	            <p>Myself, learning the meaning of leadership along the way, understanding never to ask of your men what you wouldn't ask of yourself, leading by example, learning the true meaning of honesty and integrity in leadership. </p>
	            <p>One does not win alone, and I do what it takes to make sure my team is the winning team, without ever needing to compromise my integrity or values.</p>
	            <p>I also know in order to succeed, the leader of a team must always have the team in mind during any decision making process. If the leader does not let the team down, the team will not let the leader down.</p>
	            <p>I believe I would be a valuable player on any team I join. Whether I am leading or following, I will ensure I keep the team first and the direction forward.</p> 
	            <p>I welcome all requests to join winning teams. If you would like to contact me in regards to a position on your team, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:matthew.a.ford1@gmail.com" rel="Matthew Ford Email">matthew.a.ford1@gmail.com</a>.</p>
